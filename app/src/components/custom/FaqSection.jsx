    question: "How accurate is the AI analysis?",
    answer: "Our AI is trained on millions of data points, including successful resumes and job descriptions across various industries. While it provides highly relevant feedback, it's designed to augment, not replace, human judgment. It excels at identifying ATS compatibility issues, keyword alignment, clarity, and common best practices.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-2",
    question: "Is my data secure? What happens to my resume?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We use secure protocols for file uploads and processing. For free analyses, your resume file and any pasted job description are automatically deleted from our servers shortly after the analysis is complete. If you sign up for an account, you'll have the option to save your documents securely.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-3",
    question: "What file types are supported?",
    answer: "Currently, we support the most common resume formats: PDF (.pdf), Microsoft Word (.doc and .docx). Ensure your file is not password-protected or an image scan for best results.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-4",
    question: "How is this different from a grammar checker or basic template builder?",
    answer: "We go far beyond grammar and templates. Our AI analyzes the *content* and *context* of your resume against job requirements and industry standards. We provide feedback on skill alignment, impact quantification, ATS compatibility, clarity from a recruiter's perspective, and potential skill gaps â€“ areas basic tools don't cover.",
